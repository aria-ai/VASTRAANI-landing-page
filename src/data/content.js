  heading: "OUR STORY",
  content: `Vastraani began with a simple belief — that clothing is a form of devotion.

From hand-painted art to thoughtfully stitched silhouettes, our journey is rooted in culture, emotion, and gratitude. We honour Indian craftsmanship, celebrate feminine grace, and create designs that speak softly yet leave a lasting impression.

Every collection is inspired by life's deeper moments — Nature, memories, festivals, relationships, and the beauty within simplicity.

Vastraani is not a brand. It is a feeling — of purity, pride, and personal expression.`,
